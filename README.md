# Technify Academic AI Assistant (TAIA) 🎓🤖

> AI-powered academic assistant integrated with Technify University ERP

## 🏗️ Project Overview

TAIA is an intelligent chatbot microservice that integrates with the Technify University ERP system. It provides natural language support to students, faculty, and administrators for academic queries.

**Key Features:**
- 💬 Natural language Q&A for academic information
- 🔒 Role-based access control (Student, Faculty, Admin, Finance, Exam Officer)
- 📚 Knowledge base with RAG for university policies
- 📊 Study recommendations and planning
- 🔗 Secure ERP API integration (no direct database access)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Python 3.11+ | Core language |
| FastAPI | Web framework |
| LangChain | LLM orchestration |
| ChromaDB | Vector database for RAG |
| Groq / Llama 3.3 | LLM backbone |
| JWT | Authentication |

## 🚀 Quick Start & Deployment

We have prepared a comprehensive setup guide that covers everything from Git cloning, environment variables, Mock Data generation, and Docker Deployment.

**Please refer to the official [TAIA Setup & Deployment Guide](./team_setup_guide.md) for full instructions.**

### Key Deployment Features
- **Development Mode**: Run locally with direct access to FastAPI, Mock ERP, and the Flask Frontend.
- **Production Mode**: One-click deployment using `docker-compose up --build -d` which spins up the AI Gateway, Mock ERP, and a Redis container.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Integrated UI dashboard to view all user queries, latency metrics, and roles from the SQLite audit logs.
